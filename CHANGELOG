        High-order Lagrangian Hydrodynamics Miniapp


Version 2.0, released on Nov 19, 2018
=====================================

- Support Bernstein (positive) basis for the velocity when using partial
  assembly (-pa option).

- Added CUDA version in the cuda/ directory.

- Added RAJA version in the raja/ directory.

- Added OCCA version in the occa/ directory.

- Added Adaptive Mesh Refinement version in the amr/ directory.

- Replaced a viscosity "if statement" with a smooth step function.


Version 1.1, released on Sep 28, 2018
=====================================

- Added a new example: Gresho vortex.

- Added instructions for building the CUDA and RAJA versions.

- Added a conservative time integrator (RK2Avg).

- Added computation of total energy.

- Split the LagrangianHydroOperator::Mult() into separate functions for
  assembly, velocity solve, internal energy solve.

- Improved the computations of the matrix diagonal by contracting the squares of
  the B matrices.

- Added diagonal preconditioners for both partial and full assembly.

- Fixed a bug in the evaluation of the material gamma values.

- Additional meshes that can be used for scaling tests.


Version 1.0, released on Dec 7, 2017
====================================

- Initial release.
